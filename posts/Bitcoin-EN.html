  <span class="color left">B</span>itcoin is a technological innovation that presents us with a solution to a very old
  problem: how to transfer something of value between two or more entities in a private way and through a mutually
  accepted medium of exchange. Money, which has been a central part of our civilization and of our ability to
  interact with each other, is now becoming, for the first time in history, an entirely digitized medium in the
  virtual space of the internet.
</p>
<p>
  Every time there has been a new way of transferring value between people, this change has been accompanied by a new
  era of technological innovations and an increase in the prosperity of its users. With Bitcoin we are now seeing the
  same revolution happening again, but in this revolution we are getting a technology with a global reach never before
  seen. Let's look at some of the implications of this:
<ul>
  <li>By having a global audience we can transfer value among any number of people <strong>anywhere on the
      planet</strong>.</li>
  <li>It does not require any permission from third parties to allow a transaction to occur, only the approval of the
    two or more parties involved in the exchange.</li>
  <li>Your money can be <strong>securely stored and used</strong> anywhere on the planet, completely <strong>eliminating
      any barriers or problems derived from moving money between countries</strong>.</li>
  <li>Establishes a fully deflationary asset with a <strong>fixed number of units in stock</strong>, becoming, for the
    first time in history, the first <strong>truly scarce asset</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
  Before I start with the article, I would like to throw three questions into the air that may well serve as a summary
  of what
  what you will find in this article:
<ul>
  <li>What is money?</li>
  <li>What properties make good money?</li>
  <li>Is a scarce and decentralized digital asset useful?</li>
</ul>

<section id="header-2">
  <h3 class="color">Origins of money</h3>
  <p>
    Beads, stones, small objects and animals have been used throughout human history as a medium of exchange.
    Why would someone choose an object as a means of payment instead of barter?
  </p>
  <p>
    Historically, there has always been a need for bartering between people, for example, a farmer who wants to exchange
    some of his laying hens for a donkey because he finds a greater need for a donkey which can move a mill to grind
    grain. We can immediately see the limits of this type of exchange, because if he only have one hen and our buyer
    does not see enough value in that hen he won't be able to exchange it for a donkey.
  </p>
  <p>
    Understanding now the intrinsic limits in barter, where each of the parties must offer something of a very similar
    value in order for both to accept the offer, we can see why the need to offer a means of payment commonly accepted
    by both parties arises. In other words, the difficulty of being able to offer something that the other party wants
    leads to the search for a useful means of exchange. This means of payment, whether precious metals or stones, allow
    for the transfer of value between two or more people in a much simpler and more rigorous way. Something which the
    great economists from the Austrian school of economics deeply understood, that is, a good means of payment is one
    that has certain properties which make it better valued by society:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>It must be a scarce commodity whose total quantity can never be significantly increased over time.</li>
    <li>
      It must have the capacity to be exchanged for any good in a simple way, that is, it must be easy to transport and
      be must able to be divided in such a way as to make it possible to acquire cheap things as well as those of great
      value.
    </li>
    <li>It must retain its value over time, being this an essential property for an object to be valued as money because
      it guarantees that any person can maintain his savings over a long period of time without seeing his savings
      disappear.</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    Etymologically, the word pecunia -money- comes from the Latin word Pecunia/Pecuniaes (coin), which means heads of
    livestock or simply herd/livestock. Homer himself cites it in the Iliad as money. The etymological root of
    pecunia comes from <i>Pecus/Pecoris</i> (domestic animal, cattle, sheep) and from this definition we can understand
    the origin of money:
    ancient societies used livestock as a means of exchange because it was easily transferable for other valuable goods,
    although it lacked the property of easy hoardability, since keeping livestock for a long period of time required
    very costly maintenance and care.
  </p>
  <p>
    Gradually new means of exchange were introduced, sometimes voluntarily and others by imposition, such as, for
    example; salt, which was easily transferable and could act as a store of value -<i>Salary</i> comes from salt-;
    tobacco, used in places where there was no access to other resources, as in the case of jails or concentration
    camps; bronze rings in West Africa; shells in Uganda; and even stones, as we will see below in a very particular
    case where an island society traded mainly with stones of different sizes.
  </p>
  <p>
    If money is freely chosen in the market; retains its value over time; can be transferred without difficulty and can
    be fractioned and grouped in small and large scales, <b>it is an efficient and ideal currency for everyday use</b>.
    The main enemy of such a currency are those entities that try to alter and manipulate the existing and future supply
    of this currency in order to benefit themselves, which is the reason why throughout the history of mankind we have
    been changing from one currency to another
    until, little by little, we have been finding those that more faithfully fulfill the previous properties.
  </p>
  <p>
    As Ludwig von Mises explains in "The Theory of Credit and Money":
  </p>
  <blockquote class="border-left">
    <p>
      <i>
        Thus the sound-money principle has two aspects. It is affirmative in approving the market's choice of a commonly
        used medium of exchange. It is negative in obstructing the government's propensity to meddle with the currency
        system.

    <h4 class="color">The island of stone money</h4>
    <p>
      To understand the power that Bitcoin has, we can study how primitive civilizations used and suffered the problems
      of a weak currency, as in the case of the rai stones on the island of Yap.
      In 1903, William Henry Furness III, an American anthropologist, studied in detail the curious economy of the
      inhabitants of the island of Yap. And he was so impressed that he wrote a book titled <i>The Island of Stone Money
        (1910)</i>.
    </p>

      <figcaption class='caption-text'>“Stone money Island”, Book by William Henry Furness where he describes the
        monetary customs of the Yap.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <blockquote class="border-left">
      <p>
        <i>
          “Since the island has no precious metals, they had to resort to stones. The stones in which a lot of work was
          invested in transporting and decorating are a representation of work, like the mined and minted coins of the
          civilized world. minted coins of the civilized world. Their medium of exchange, which they call fei (or rai),
          consists of large, solid, thick stone wheels, with a diameter ranging from one to twelve feet. They have in
          the center a hole of different sizes, depending on the diameter of the stone, into which a stick is inserted
          to facilitate transportation.
          Those 'coin stones' (made from a limestone found on an island 400 miles away) are originally mined and carved
          on that island, and the product is transported to Yap in canoes and rafts. An interesting feature of this
          stone coin is that it is not necessary for its owner to have possession. When a transaction is made for an
          amount that involves a fei too large to move, the new owner has no problem with the stone remaining in the
          same place as before, as long as ownership is acknowledged”.
        </i>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      The interesting thing I want to highlight with this story is how the exchange of stones between the inhabitants of
      the island arises through the free choice of its inhabitants as a means of payment. It is interesting because,
      without any coercion from any authority, the inhabitants have decided that stones served thembest in order to
      trade their products in a more efficient way than through the exchange of livestock or food, for example. This is
      important because it helps us to clarify a number of qualities that make an object a good candidate as a medium of
      exchange. These qualities are:
    <ul>
      <li>Divisible. The rai stones had different sizes that allowed them to be exchanged for goods of varying value,
        from the smallest goods and services to larger ones such as property or land.</li>
      <li>Convenience of transport. These stones could be transported by their owners which facilitated their exchange
        and their ability to protect them from theft and, in the case of the larger stones, the ownership of the of the
        stone was transferred from owner to owner without the need to move it.</li>
      <li>Limited in supply. In the case of the rai stones, it was necessary to sail to one of the nearby islands to
        extract the stone and through a work of the the stone to be able to transport it to the population centers. This
        prevented a person or groups of people from bringing into the market a huge amount of stones with which they
        could
        buy anything of value at a bargain and subsequently destabilize the value of the stones.</li>
    </ul>
    As a curious fact about this story, one of these foreigners who came to visit this islands, upon learning that
    limestone was being traded in those islands and knowing the ease with which one can find these stones if one has
    large ships and the appropriate technology, he dared to send to those islands massive quantities of limestone at
    which point he began to trade with the natives to exchange this limestone for goods he considered to be of greater
    value. The inhabitants of these islands were very happy with the foreigner because they could increase their stone
    reserves thanks to the appearance of this foreigner with these enormous stones.
    For the leaders of these peoples this was a serious problem and they tried by all means to prevent this foreigner
    from being able to trade with them, something that they could not avoid because the islanders were more than happy
    to trade with him.
    </p>
    <p>Here we can see reflected one of the great problems that mankind has faced in the search for those forms of money
      which are useful as a means exchange and which can minimize the enormous problem that an almost instantaneous
      appearance on the market of an enormous quantity of money can bring. If there is a quick and cheap way of
      obtaining an enormous quantity of that money, then what avoids the eventual devaluation of that currency when it
      enter the market? Those who have access to these ways of increasing the production of money are
      precisely the first to take advantage of trading with this new monetary mass, eventually causing a devaluation of
      the currency that will only later be noticed by the holders of this currency and which will be reflected in an
      increase in the cost of products and a decrease in the purchasing power of the owners of the currency. In other
      words, if we look at for example the ECB (European Central Bank, in the case of the Euro) and the FED (US Federal
      Reserve for the US Dollar), we can see how these are the only entities with the legal capacity to increase the
      money supply by issuing new financial debt, in a system known as <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_easing">Quantitative Easing</a> and, precisely because they are
      the only ones with this capacity, it is they themselves who can clearly benefit from using this new money supply
      in the way which suits them best, so that in the present monetary system, the order of arrival and of access to
      this new monetary mass always passes through the hands of the central banks, to the detriment of a society that
      lives tied to a system that constantly devalues its currency, impoverishing its holders more and more every year.

  <p>
    When we look at the history of the Roman Empire and its eventual disintegration as an empire, we tend to fall into
    the error of believing that it was precisely because of the constant invasions of the Germanic tribes that this
    empire fell, dethroning the kings of the Mediterranean, a cultured and refined society. Unfortunately this is not
    true, since the economic management of the empire in its last centuries and the inexhaustible tributary thirst of
    its emperors are truly to blame as the culprits of the decadence and eventual fall of this empire.
  </p>
  <p>
    The stories tell that during the rule of Emperor Septimius Severus in the year 211, the emperor gathered his two
    sons, Caracalla and Greta, on his deathbed while his armies were fighting against the Picts in Britannia. Septimius
    gave them one last piece of advice regarding the government of the empire he was bequeathing them: "Live in harmony,
    enrich the army, ignore the rest". Both sons promised to fulfill these precepts but Caracalla ended up killing his
    brother to rule alone. It was at this point that the decline of Rome began. He began by increasing the salaries of
    the soldiers by 50%,
    followed by an almost doubling of the inheritance tax, and as this was not enough, he devalued the currency to
    afford his pharaonic expenses such as the baths that bear his name, the main hall of which is larger than St.
    Peter's in the Vatican.
  </p>
  <p>
    How was the currency devalued? Noble metals were mixed with other less valuable metals, so that each silver or gold
    coin had less and less silver and gold, and more and more bronze and other cheap metals. Caracalla's idea was to
    debase the coin without anyone noticing it in order to be able to afford the expenses that his new government
    required.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Roman currency was the denarius -this is where our word money comes from-, and it was originally composed of
    pure silver. This changed over time because, as we have just said, starting with the emperor Augustus and continuing
    with the successive emperors, including Marcus Aurelius, a percentage of silver was subtracted and other metals
    where added such as bronze. This process began with a small reduction of 5% of the total silver coinage and after
    several generations it ended up being a composition of 50% silver and the rest of other metals.
  </p>
  <p>
    The aureus -of gold, logically- was also affected by the emperors' thirst for power and monetary perversion. From
    the reign of Augustus, each pound of gold yielded about forty coins, and during the reign of Caracalla, each pound
    of gold yielded fifty coins. The constant devaluation of the currency subjected the Roman empire to the worst
    moments of its existence, accelerating its fall and forcing the golden age of Rome into the history books.
  </p>
  <section id="sub-header-2">
    <h4 class="color">What were the consequences of the currency devaluation?</h4>
    <p>
      During this period of currency devaluation, inflation surpassed 1000%, according to the small data available to
      us, so at some points it could have been higher than this value. This led to a general impoverishment of the
      population, who had to constantly trade away their denarius -which were no longer but silver-plated bronze coins-,
      at such a rate that they passed from hand to hand with no one to treasure them. This monetary effect is known as
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gresham%27s_law">Gresham's Law</a>, which, in short, is simply the fact
      that if two legal tender currencies circulate simultaneously in a society, one considered as "good" and the other
      as "bad", the "bad" one will always be used by this society in the marketplace as medium of exchange, while the
      "good" one will be hoarded as a store of value, taking the "good" currency out of the market.
    </p>
    <p>
      This inflation had repercussions not only on the Romans themselves, who saw their wealth disappearing as the
      government's wealth grew, but it also affected in a generalized way many sectors related to the economy, such as
      industry, commerce and agriculture. This in turn led to a material impoverishment of society that would eventually
      be recorded in the history books as the decline of the Roman Empire. In order to survive in the Rome of the fourth
      and fifth centuries, it was necessary to depend on the state and its redistribution of wealth, in addition to
      hoard what little gold one could get in order to subsist. The collapse of the Roman Empire, accelerated by the
      disastrous economic management of its rulers, banished Rome to the history books, leaving a void in the West that
      would take a thousand years to be replaced.

  <p>
    Returning to Bitcoin, and understanding now where the potential of a means of payment to become good money lies,
    let's see why Bitcoin is a fundamental tool to keep control over our savings and our financial freedom. Bitcoin is
    the <b>first open monetary network on the planet</b> and the first <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software">open source</a> system where cryptography
    experts and developers can contribute to improve <b>a system that can be used by anyone with an internet connection
      without any intermediary</b>. In short, the fact that Bitcoin is an open source system brings with it the
    advantages of being able to offer the best developments in the modern world for billions of people who, for the most
    part, do not have access to a bank account.
  </p>
  <p>
    Bitcoin is a true technological innovation that combines the best of open source developments with its decentralized
    nature, which is the basis of this great technological revolution, allowing anyone to transfer value between each
    other <b>without any intermediary</b>, enabling for the first time in history a means of exchange which is global
    and of relatively easy access, being especially valuable for less advanced and disadvantaged societies.
  </p>
  <p>
    If a global catastrophe such as a natural disaster or a global war were to occur, we would likely lose some level of
    freedom and stability, one could argue that many of the technological advances we take for granted would cease to
    work as we would inevitably fall into a state of emergency. If this were to happen, Bitcoin would still be active
    since due to its decentralized nature and thanks to the incorporation of new devices and ways of of sustaining
    network activity even in economically devastated societies such as, for example, in Venezuela with the devices being
    used during these last few years (see <a href="https://locha.io/">Locha Mesh</a>), shows us that the power of this
    technology and its usefulness lies in its ability to perform and maintain a decentralized and open access structure.

      matter in the universe. If we look at the image above, we can see how the universe forms a three-dimensional
      network with clusters of galaxies and empty space. This same structure can be seen in the webs that form the
      mycelium under our feet, or rather under the earth, which allows it to decompose complex molecules into simpler
      and simpler elements so that trees and plants can absorb them through their roots. Likewise the neuronal

      decentralization, fosters its resilience while decreasing the likelihood of it being brought down by an attack
      from a

      Bitcoin has been operating for more than 10 years without any errors or interruptions, mainly due to its
      decentralized structure. To understand the importance of decentralization we must know what bitcoin is. The
      Bitcoin technology and the blockchain is basically a digital transaction register which stores, among other
      important and interesting data, the transfer of a sum of digits -bitcoins- from the owner of those digits, to
      another entity. This registry of millions and millions of transactions between different entities and with varying
      amounts of bitcoins is, in short, the core of bitcoin technology and the blockchain.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we have said, Bitcoin is a technology that tends towards decentralization, which means that the blockchain -the
      global transaction log- is not held by a single entity, such as a central bank, but exists simultaneously in
      thousands and thousands of nodes across the globe. These nodes are nothing more than small computational systems
      with a database -to store the register- and capabilities to communicate with each other through an internet
      connection (or simply with the ability to communicate by satellite). As there is constant communication between
      all the nodes that make up the Bitcoin network, and because all of the nodes have an exact copy of the
      <b>unique</b> record of all global transactions, the ability for a malicious entity to "misrepresent" or "tamper"
      with the bitcoins in circulation becomes exponentially more difficult the greater the number of nodes that make up
      this network. That is why it is often said that at the Bitcoin's early life, one of the main barriers to its
      global adoption was that since there were only a few nodes, if any hacker managed to gain control of these nodes -
      known as a <a href="https://en.bitcoinwiki.org/wiki/51%25_attack">51% attack</a>-, they could technically alter
      the register and "steal" as many bitcoins as they wanted. Today, on the contrary, the number of active nodes in
      the Bitcoin network makes it virtually impossible for any hacker to alter the Bitcoin registry.

    <p>
      Jack Mallers, CEO of <a href="https://strike.me/">Strike</a>, is a young entrepreneur who has dedicated the last
      <a href="https://strike.me/">5+ years</a> of his life exclusively to studying and understanding bitcoin technology
      and especially the second layer technology called lightning network. Strike is a system that utilizes the
      Lightning Network to provide anyone on the planet with a platform to transfer money from any country in the world
      to any other country in the world. This means that an American citizen can send U.S. dollars to an English citizen
      and the latter can receive the money in pounds almost instantly. How?
    </p>
    <p>
      Through the use of the Lightning Network, dollars are withdrawn from the US user's bank account and instantly
      converted into Bitcoin, specifically a version of Bitcoin optimized for the Lightning Network. It is then sent
      through the Bitcoin network to the recipient almost instantaneously, across borders without paying any fees, and
      is ultimately exchanged for pounds, which the recipient receives in his or her bank account.
    </p>
    <p>
      As if this new near-zero cost instant payment platform were not enough, in a brilliant chess move, Jack Mallers
      offers the ability to buy Bitcoins through his company at 0 cost, i.e. his company's business model is not to
      offer 3-5% exchange rates like the vast majority of large companies that already exist in this sector. This
      automatically makes them the biggest disruptor for all those companies such as <a
        href="https://www.coinbase.com">Coinbase</a> that receive most of their revenue from charging these exchange
      rates to their users.

      So influential is Jack Mallers' impact proving to be that, thanks to his influence in El Salvador, he has been
      able to advise its president, Nayib Bukele, to introduce Bitcoin as legal tender for every citizen of El Salvador.
      This is important news for the future of Bitcoin as it opens the door for many other countries to take the same
      steps as El Salvador. El Salvador, with 70% of its population without access to a bank account, has just offered a
      ray of hope for all of its inhabitants, as Bitcoin technology only requires internet access and a device to
      transfer Bitcoins between users, something that most Salvadorans do have at their disposal. This allows any
      Salvadoran to have in his or her pocket a technology that is superior to the technology available to any bank and,
      most importantly, <b>a technology that is uncensurable and that empowers its users to transfer value between them
        without the need of an intermediary</b>(like a bank).
    </p>
    <p>
      In the near future we will continue to see many countries seeking to censor Bitcoin, especially due to its ability
      to unseat the power of Central Banks, and we will also see other countries like El Salvador embracing this
      technology that can change and improve so many lives.

  <h3 class="color">Conclusion</h3>
  <p>
    From the origins of money to the present day, there have been infinite ways to facilitate exchange between people,
    some of them very picturesque, such as the case of the stones of the island of Yap. Today, with the technological
    revolution technology and the blockchain, we are facing a revolution of the same power or even more so than the
    arrival of the Internet in our lives. The full implications of this revolution will only be seen in the future and
    for now our most important opportunity is to inform and clarify everything related to the Bitcoin ecosystem, with
    the objective of allowing all those with a growing interest to understand and have easy access to such a
    technological revolution.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are many important topics in relation to Bitcoin that are worth doing a full article on, such as the energy
    consumption of Bitcoin or the cryptographic foundations on which the blockchain technology is based, and it is
    precisely to this task that I will dedicate my next articles, so I hope you will stay tuned to my blog for future
    articles!
  </p>
  <p>
    Before closing this post, I would like to provide a series of key ideas to always keep in mind when trying to
    understand this technology. <a href="https://aantonop.com/" class='color'>Andreas Antonopoulos</a>, a very prominent
    speaker in the Bitcoin space, has been very precise about these key ideas and serves as a great synthesis to what we
    will be covering in future articles:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Open</strong>: Accesible to everyone.</li>
    <li><strong>Without borders</strong>: Accesible from anywhere in the planet.</li>
    <li><strong>Descentralized</strong>: There is no centralization of power which can be exploited.</li>
    <li><strong>Resistant to censorship</strong>: Inaccesible to any form of suppresion or control.</li>
    <li><strong>Neutral</strong>: Profides a powerful service without any political or moral implication.</li>
  </ul>
