      Try to learn to breathe deeply, really to taste food when you eat, and when you sleep, really to sleep. Try as
      much as possible to be wholly alive with all your might, and when you laugh, laugh like hell. And when you get

  <span class="color left">W</span>hen we are born, we take in our first breath of air. When we die, we exhale our last.
  As a matter of fact, in some languages the word "exhale" is a synonym to "dying". Breathing, then, is presented to us
  as an indissociable part of human life, forming the base and source of every act in our lives. Breathing can promote
  vitality in the body and mind or, as if it was a double edged sword, negatively affect our cognitive capacity and our
  perfomance in daily life.
</p>
<p>
  Our breathing is such an important part of our quality of life that it can suprise us to know that, in the Western
  world, it is hardly given any importance at all. Here the internal processes of the body like breathing or the
  digestive processes are studied as mere mechanical processes, eliminating from this processes its most important
  qualities: the revitalization of the body and the source of all the energy for our cells.
</p>
<p>
  For this reason it is no wonder that close to ninety perecnt of us utilize less than fifty percent of our lung
  capacity. Given this fact and as a consequence of it, I decided to learn about the impact that breathing can have on
  our lives not only to amplify my knowledge about it, but also so I can offer a new point of view for those readers who
  this find this topic fascinating too.
</p>
<p>
  With the wisdom of our history, we see how already in the first millennium B.C. both Taoism and Hinduism focused their
  attention on a certain <i>vital principle</i> or <i>energy</i> which flows through the body, coming to consider
  breathing as one of its manifestations. The Taoists called this principle <i>qi</i> while the Hindus considered it as
  <i>prana</i> (one of the key concepts of yoga). In China, the term <i>Qiqong</i> refers to the cultivation of life and
  a series of practices that combine exercises,
  breaths and meditations for the expansion of the <i>life force</i>.
</p>
<p>
  Later, in the West, the Greeks used the term <i>pneuma</i> and the Hebrews the term <i>rûah</i> to refer to the breath
  and the divine presence. Even in Latin, the word <i>spiritus</i> is part of the root of the words "spirit" and
  "breath". In yoga, this "force" or "energy" that accompanies the breath was considered so important that they
  developed breathing techniques to increase this energy. These techniques were called <i>pranayama</i> (<i>prana-</i>
  life force, <i>-ayama</i>, control).
</p>
<p>
  As a form of introduction, I am going to place two questions in the reader's mind in order to open his appetite and
  desire
  to discover the incredible world of conscious breathing that opens up before us in the West as it already made
  centuries ago in the East.

  when I decided to research and write down my knowledge about breathing and its importance. With this small personal
  learning exercise I also hope to bring an enrichment in the Western society today about the usefulness of improving
  our breathing processes through a holistic view where body and mind work together and at the same time try to expand
  the interest in ancient history and the way of understanding life that our ancestors valued deeply.

  <h4 class="color">The call of our forefathers.</h4>
  <p>
    Throughout human history, certain traditions have emerged where the breath had acquired a fundamental role, as is
    the case for the yogic tradition in India and its practices of <i>pranayama</i>) or Taoism in China, where the
    objective of breath control is to "prolong life" by "feeding the life principle". In the case of yoga, from its
    conception, one of the fundamental characteristics is the abolition (or overcoming) of the human condition through
    the "denial" of human activities. In other words, through yoga, with its different <i>asanas</i> (postures) and
    disciplines such as <i>pranayama</i> (breathing techniques), we are trying to deny the characteristic movement of
    every human being, the "denial" of physical movements through the practice of <i>asanas</i> and the "denial" of the
    natural process of respiration through <i>pranayama</i> and the retention of the breath. In the case of of the
    asanas, its
    effectiveness lies in the ability to rest in certain postures without any form of physical effort, thus allowing the
    mind to forget about the body and sustain a focused attention, something that only happens once the postures have
    been practiced for some time. This "negative" to the movement, being movement something totally natural in the human
    being, allows the yogi to enter into meditative states where he is able to acquire the <i>ekagrata</i> (fixed and
    uninterrupted concentration in an object/idea).
  </p>
  <p>
    With respecto to <i>pranayama</i>, the "negative" is towards arrhythmic breathing, common to all men. Therefore
    the yogi seeks to control his breathing and make it as rhythmic and calm as possible. Bhoja, Indian king during
    the 21st century AD, helps us to reveal the deep meaning of <i>pranayama</i>:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      <i>As all organ functions are preceded by the respiratory function - since there is a link between
        the breath and the consciousness, in their respective functions - the breath, being suspended all
        organic functions, performs the concentration of the consciousness in a single object.</i>
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    This relationship alluded to by Bhoja, the relationship between the breath and the states of consciousness, (by
    (e.g., the more agitated breathing of an angry person or the calm breathing of someone who is focused)
    shows that they not only knew its importance long ago, but they had already experienced and observed how different
    forms of breathing could help in the process of <i>ascesis</i> (self-control) in a way that allows the yogi to
    penetrate into deeper states of consciousness. The objective of these practices is to acquire a greater control
    over their consciousness so that by reducing the rate of breathing one can enter alternative states of
    consciousness such as the state we enter during deep sleep. By gaining some control over the breath and by
    lengthening each breath more and more, which occurs naturally in soporific states (when the
    active mind disappears and we enter a deep sleep) the yogi can consciously enter those states of consciousness where
    the majority of people would fall unconscious (as is the case when we dream), thus acquiring greater control and
    continuity over their consciousness.
  </p>
  <p>
    The real objective of <i>pranayama</i> is the prolonged suspension of breathing, obtained by progressively
    increasing the length of each breath. This objective is described by Patanjali, who lived around the II d.C and was
    the author of the <i>yoga-sutra</i>- which is considered the first treatise of yoga written in Sanskrit (although in
    the Bhagavad-gita the basis of yoga already appears)- as the harmonization of the three "moments" of breathing: the
    aspiration (<i>puraka</i>), the expiration (<i>recaka</i>) and breath retention (<i>khumbaka</i>).
  </p>
  <p>
    Taking into account the historical importance that Hindu traditions and, later on, many other
    traditions have given to the breath, we can suggest that as it already happened in the east centuries ago, now in
    the West there appears to be a resurgence in the attention and understanding we have of our own breathing. Through
    science and experimentation we are rediscovering what our ancestors already knew and had left in ancient texts:
    how through breathing we can obtain greater control of our body and our mind so that we can discover our
    consciousness and its deepest layers with complete attention.
    I do not intend to show the more spiritual characteristics of these practices as I believe that this is the
    responsibility of those curious enough to find out. For this reason I will limit myself to spreading knowledge
    about the latest discoveries done by science about the breath and its importance in order to improve our daily
    life. Therefore I hope that the following paragraphs may be of great interest to those seeking to know more about
    their own breath and the benefits they can
    gain by adopting simple breathing practices.

  <h3 class="color">What is breathing?</h3>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      "The importance of breathing need hardly be stressed. It provides the oxygen for the metabolic processes;
      literally it supports the fires of life. But breath as "pneuma" is also the spirit or soul. We live in an ocean of
      air like fish in a body of water. By our breathing we are attuned to our atmosphere. If we inhibit our breathing
      we isolate ourselves from the medium in which we exist. In all Oriental and mystic philosophies, the breath holds
      the secret to the highest bliss. That is why breathing is the dominant factor in the practice of Yoga."

    There are an infinite number of processes happening in our body every hour of every day, processes that thanks to
    millions of years of evolution happen without the intervention of the conscious mind. This is because these
    processes, which occur repetitively and systematically, have caused our organism to learn to control it and to
    manage it automatically; from our heartbeat, the control of the acid/alkaline balance of the blood (pH), the
    regulation of breathing, or even the release of hormones and chemicals in the brain are, in short, a multitude of
    processes that allow the body to stay alive. This does not mean, as we will see later, that we cannot influence
    these processes in a positive way, helping or improving their functionality, because as already demonstrated in the
    East with the practices of yoga, especially the practice of pranayama, the breathing can become a tool to influence
    and enhance the processes that normally occur below the level of consciousness, even processes which are usually
    considered as automatic or autonomous.
  </p>
  <p>
    In order to discover how we can substantially improve our performance in sport and our quality of life through
    breathing, as well as alleviating and shortening the suffering a person can face in certain moments of
    their life, we should first understand a little better how the respiratory system works. It is for this
    reason that I have decided to include below a brief summary about the functioning of the respiratory system.
  </p>
  <p>
    Before we start to study the breath it is good to keep in mind that, unlike what may seem to at first glance, the
    process of breathing does not occur only in the lungs, but actually includes a
    series of muscles from very diverse areas such as the head, neck, chest and abdomen. Which means that although the
    breathing process itself occurs within the lungs, as this is where the process of
    transfer of oxygen and carbon dioxide is born and ends, it is important to emphasize the importance that a large
    part of the
    body has about the correct functioning of the breathing mechanisms. Evidently, by taking into account that the
    breath includes various parts of the body it may be easier for us to understand that any chronic stress or problems
    with our muscles can cause our oxygenation capacity to decrease considerably. This can have
    negative consequences for our organism in the long term if we do not recover a correct posture and a good
    coordination in the breathing process, which includes the correct use of certain muscles such as the diaphragm and
    abdomen.
  </p>
  <section id="sub-header-2">
    <h4 class="color">The process of Breathing</h4>
    <p>
      To study the breathing process we can divide it into three basic parts, inhalation, exhalation and the retention
      periods that occur naturally between each of them as they repeat rhythmically.
    </p>
    <ul class="numeral-list">
      <li class="numeral">
        The process begins with an inhalation that, in the same way as a wave advancing from the bottom upwards,
        begins to fill the lungs from the bottom, at which point the pelvis begins to move backwards allowing the
        abdomen and stomach to expand forward. As more air is entering the lungs, the thorax and the upper part of the
        lungs begin to widen until it reaches the neck and the head, where the clavicle tends to expand and the head
        tends to become erect in order to open the respiratory system to the maximum so as to allow for a complete
        filling of the
        lungs. It should be noted that the diaphragm not only serves to separate the digestive organs from the lungs
        and heart and to facilitate other processes such as excretion of fluids, but serves as the main component of our
        ability to suck air into the lungs. As the diaphragm contracts, there is an increase in the space available in
        the thoracic cavity, thus producing a negative pressure that allows the air to enter the lungs.
      </li>
      <li class="numeral">
        When you exhale the process happens in reverse. It starts with the expulsion of air from the higher parts of the
        respiratory tract and continuing downward as the clavicle and thorax contract. Afterwards, the abdomen and
        diaphragm begins relaxing as we release the last reserves of air. In this last part of the process, we can
        slightly tighten the muscles of the abdomen inward to force the lungs to expel air from the lower parts of the
        lungs. If when we inhale the pelvis is displaced backwards, when exhaling the opposite happens, it moves forward
        returning to its initial position.
      </li>
      <li class="numeral">
        In those moments where the change of phase occurs, from inhalation to exhalation or the other way round, there
        are small moments of quietness where the air neither enters nor leaves. These moments, which can be compared to
        the moment when a wave finishes forming a ridge or a valley and starts to change its direction, producing a
        moment of equilibrium, is more important than at first sight one might expect of a simple pause in breathing, as
        this pause can become not only a bridge to a greater relaxation of our organism and towards a better capacity of
        attention and concentration for our mind, but it can also become a window to the unconscious and to our most
        hidden thoughts. Through practice of certain breathing techniques, this period of stasis can be consciously
        prolonged with the goal of entering a state of deep relaxation where the mind can become more serene and begin
        to be more attentive to the thoughts and sensations of the body. In these states of relaxation the body
        activates the parasympathetic system, which is very beneficial to recover energy and help the body to regenerate
        itself at the cellular level, as I will explain later.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Understanding now the mechanical process of a correct breathing pattern, we can start to practice a more conscious
      breathing
      anywhere and at any time. Simply take a long, deep breath through
      the nostrils, allowing the abdomen to expand and fill the lungs fully. When inhaling, it is convenient to keep
      the muscles of the shoulders, neck and chest relaxed to increase the feeling of fullness and completeness. We can
      exhale gently and naturally, without forcing the air out, and as the transitions between inhalation and exhalation
      occur, try to make those changes smooth and without pause, trying to avoid the retention of air inside lungs. If
      you are interested in deepening your breathing techniques, then the practice of breathholding, where the aim is to
      stop breathing for a long time, can become
      a very important element in producing positive physiological changes in the body and its stress response. This is
      because although holding one's breath causes a rise in stress and cortisol levels in the brain in the short term,
      it usually causes the opposite effect in the long term through daily short breath retention exercises, that is,
      the body develops a better stress management as a result of these retention practices, something that any diver or
      athlete of apnea knows perfectly well.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we deepen our practice of conscious breathing we can learn to
      scan our body with our mind in search of those areas where we notice a pain that we want to relieve and, by
      directing our attention to that pain, we can learn to enter the pain and surrender to it, thus relieving it and
      providing
      a much needed relaxation for the affected area as a consequence of this conscious attention. This same method can
      be employed for the mind, where by observing those negative thoughts that settle in our mind for short periods
      of time and by devoting sufficient attention to them, we can dissolve them so that they can give rise to more
      positive
      thoughts. Here the key is not to deny the physical or mental pain, something that only serves to repress it and
      perpetuate it in the depths of consciousness where it will continue to harm us, but in analyzing and observing it
      with the mind to fully understand it and, as a consequence, become able to reduce its influence on us. This idea-
      forthrightly confronting the pain- always requires more effort than burying it under medication or juggling the
      mind to avoid paying attention to it, but it is of vital importance because, as C.G. Jung would say:
    </p>
    <blockquote class="border-left">
      <p>
        <i>
          What you deny submits you, what you accept transforms you.
        </i>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Hence the importance of conscious attention and breathing as a bridge to acquire this attention, because by paying
      attention to the pains or problems we become stronger and more able to overcome them, while by simply denying or
      repressing them we only learn to endure suffering, something that makes us weak and fragile. This is why I have
      embarked on this path of learning and research, with the hopes of being able to shed some light and clarity on
      this issues for those who accompany me in the reading this essay.

    <h4 class="color">Our Inmune system and Nervous System</h4>
    <p>
      To better understand our breathing it is also necessary to know more about the functioning of the immune system
      and the nervous system in the body because, as science continues moving forward, it is becoming increasingly clear
      that the breath has a great influence on these systems. Briefly explained, our immune system is composed by a
      network of organs, tissues, proteins and special cells, and has the objective to protect the body from dangerous
      germs and microorganisms. How do these microorganisms get into our
      body? Through the main entry ways which are; the intestinal walls for those foods that we consume and whose
      constitutive elements will become part of our organism, and the respiratory tract where microorganisms can find
      access to the bloodstream as they descend into the alveoli. By understanding this we can clearly see how a good
      diet and a powerful breathing full of fresh air can prevent us from contracting diseases and help us to keep our
      body in an optimal state to counteract those germs and harmful microorganisms.
    </p>
    <p>
      The nervous system, as its name suggests, is composed of a series of nerves that begin in the
      brain and expand towards different parts of the body. In the case of the central nervous system, through the spine
      down to the base of the spine and in the case of the peripheral nervous system, to all organs and members of the
      body. Thanks to the nervous system we can detect and control thousands of processes in the body
      through millions of electrical pulses that are sent to and from the brain, which acts as the center of operations,
      regulating the release of hormones and supplying chemicals and electrical impulses to the other organs of the
      body. Within the peripheral nervous system we find the autonomic nervous system, which controls the involuntary
      functions of the organs, such as the frequency of
      heart rate, breathing rate, sweating, salivation, dilated pupils. I do not intend to go into detail about the
      nervous system but I do want to make clear its importance so, in brief, I am going to show you some key facts
      about
      the autonomic nervous system, which is subdivided into these two systems:
    </p>
    <ul class="numeral-list">
      <li class="numeral">
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sympathetic_nervous_system">Simpatic Nervous System</a>:
        <ul>
          <li>Activated in moments of stress, it initiates the main motor functions of the body.</li>
          <li>Raises heart rate.</li>
          <li>Dilates the pupils.</li>
          <li>Reduces blood circulation towards the digestive organs and increases circulation towards muscles and motor
            functions.</li>
          <li>As we can see, it is in charge of activating our body for a quick response when it spots something
            potentially dangerous and it is commonly known as the "fight or flight" response.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li class="numeral"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasympathetic_nervous_system">Parasimpathetic Nervous
          System</a>:
        <ul>
          <li>Becomes active in a state of calm and facilitates not only digestion but also the revitalization and the
            regeneration of the body.</li>
          <li>Lowers cardiac rythm and cardiac pressure while at the same time promoting digetsion and the absorption of
            nutrients.</li>
          <li>It is the primary promoter of regeneration and of the correct functioning of our system.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Considering now the importance of our nervous and immune system, it is important to know that through breathing
      we can activate our sympathetic or parasympathetic nervous system. Although the nervous system is commonly known
      as a system that works automatically and independently of our wishes, it has recently been discovered
      that by means of certain processes such as meditation or, in this case, breathing exercises, we can activate
      these systems at will. To allow the body to enter a state where the sympathetic system acts, the system
      in charge of the "fight or flight" response, it will be necessary to perform some forced and powerful breathing
      exercises where the nerve endings of the vagus nerve are stimulated, a nerve that connects all the organs with the
      brain. This type of breathing is what will allow us to increase the concentration of oxygen in the blood thus
      facilitating our performance in sports or complex mental activities. If you want to stimulate a
      response of the parasympathetic nervous system with breathing exercises, then most of the focus must be centered
      on slow, deep breaths which will allow the body to enter that state of calm and tranquility where the
      parasympathetic system can be activated and cause a cascade of regenerative and stimulating processes in the
      body.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next, we will learn about the vital importance that oxygen and carbon dioxide have in our bodies so, once we have
      a clear understanding of a few key concepts of our breathing, continue learning how certain people and elite
      athletes are changing our conception of what is possible as humans through the art of conscious breathing,
      something which was already greatly understood through yoga hundreds of years ago in the East with it's techniques
      of <i>pranayama</i>.
    </p>

  <section id="sub-header-4">
    <h4 class="color">Why is oxygen necessary?</h4>
    <p>
      Knowing now a little better the process of breathing, at least the most mechanical part, let's see now what
      essential functions it performs within our organism, that is, what the breath is really for. The main
      function of breathing in our body is for the production of energy to maintain all the organs and our body in
      general functioning properly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The body requires a constant supply of energy in order to sustain the infinite number of processes that help
      keep the whole organism alive and functioning. This is why the metabolic processes, the processes by which matter
      is transformed into energy, are of vital importance. Within the cells that make up our body there are two main
      ways to produce this energy needed by the body. The first is through a anaerobic (does not require oxygen) process
      called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycolysis">glycolysis, a process in which the cell, by oxidizing
        the glucose it has obtained from the food that have been digested, produces energy readily available to the
        cells in the form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyruvic_acid">pyruvate</a>. This metabolic
        transformation happens in 20 steps well studied and known by science and its result, the pyruvate, can be used
        throughout the body to generate a small amount of energy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second way of producing energy, in much higher quantities than the glycolytic process, is
      through an aerobic process called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citric_acid_cycle">the Krebs Cycle</a>.
      In a series of 8 steps, the pyruvate generated by the previous process, enters the <a href
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrion">mitochondria</a> (the power station of the cells) and
      together with a good supply of oxygen produces as a result carbon dioxide and an incredible amount of
      energy ready to be used where it is needed. By way of comparison we can see that while the anaerobic pathway
      (glycolitic) produces only 2 units of energy, the aerobic process(Krebs cycle) within the mitochondria produces 36
      units of energy, making the Krebs cycle the most important source of energy for sustaining life in our body.
    </p>

    </figure>
    <p>
      As we can see, through our breathing, we are not only constantly providing oxygen to every cell through the
      aerobic processes in order to produce great quantities of energy at a far superior rate that those of the
      anaerobic processes, but also as we exhale we get rid of the carbon dioxide which appears in our body as a
      by-product of this production of energy. Therefore, breathing not only provides the components necessary to
      produce the energy needed in our body to keep us alive, but also invigorates the body, electrifies the body by
      improving the immune system and calms the body so it can regenerate completely.
    </p>
    <p>
      A good way to assess the importance of breathing is by observing the negative consequences of the lack
      oxygenation and the accumulation of carbon dioxide in the body, both being consequences of a
      very poor breathing pattern. When the levels of oxygen available in the blood and tissues are very low, we enter a
      state called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoxia_(medical)">hypoxia</a>, and when the levels of carbon
      in the blood become very high, we enter a state called <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypercapnia">hypercapnia</a>. It is interesting to know these terms because
      they
      are often the cause of many health problems that people develop throughout their lives and it is precisely through
      correct breathing that these problems can be solved.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a state of hypoxia, the mildest symptoms of damage to the body are usually a feeling of fatigue,
      lethargy, nausea or headaches. The most serious and harmful symptoms, which usually occur when maintaining a state
      of
      prolonged hypoxia, are usually permanent damage to the brain structure due to the excessive demand for
      oxygen from the brain, which cannot last more than three minutes without oxygen. Similarly, a lack of
      oxygen in the cells would cause a cascade of intracellular problems that would make regeneration and the correct
      recycling of the cells nearly impossible. In the case of hypercapnia, its main consequences are a rapid
      acidification of the bloodstream followed by an imbalance in the pH of the body in general, as it is precisely by
      breathing as the body manages to balance the internal pH and thus maintain a correct
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostasis">homeostasis</a>. The cells of the body cannot remain
      in an acidic pH environment for long periods of time without negative consequences such as the proliferation of
      cancer cells, which live in acidic pH environments and with little oxygenation. In order to restore the pH
      balance, the body tends to release greater amounts of carbon dioxide from the blood into the atmosphere and to
      absorb positive hydrogen ions, which help reduce acidification of the body. Another consequence of remaining in
      these altered states is the increased energy expenditure incurred by the body to try to combat the fungi and
      cancer cells that proliferate in these environments, something that limits the amount of energy available to
      regenerate other parts of the body.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the most important functions of carbon dioxide inside the body is its relationship to an effect called
      as <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efecto_Bohr">the Bohr effect</a>. This effect establishes that the lower
      the levels of ph - increase in acidity - the lesser the capacity of the hemoglobin to retain oxigen. This means
      that with high levels of carbon dioxide or even just high levels of hydrogen ions (+) can cause the hemoglobin in
      the red blood cells to release all their oxygen to the tissues, thus producing a large increase in energy levels
      and thus an increase in physical performance. To obtain the greatest amount of oxygen release in the tissues your
      cells need the carbon dioxide, so if we breathe heavily through the mouth - as we tend to do during heavy exercise
      - we are producing the worst possible effect for our
      body as we are only emptying our carbon dioxide levels. With this in mind we find it is easy to conclude that it
      is important to have a good balance between the levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide, because if we incur in levels
      much lower than necessary we will produce damage in our organism and if we bring unbalanced levels of these gases
      we can also produce negative effects. The easiest solution to avoid these problems will always be to try to have a
      deep but calm, slow breathing, and if we are going to perform physical exercises then we should try to use all our
      lung capacity and always remember to inhale through the nose and to exhale through the mouth, because in this way
      we can correctly oxygenate the body.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we want to avoid at all costs these states of hypoxia and hypercapnia which are so harmful to our health when
      sustained for prolonged periods of time, then we should be aware of the enormous importance that breathing has in
      order to restore the correct levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the blood. With this essay I have focused on
      the importance of breathing and therefore I do not intend to introduce such complex topics such as the
      acid/alkaline balance of the human body, but I would like to reflect a truth about food that can be useful for
      everyone. Acidic foods require more oxygen to
      burn and produce energy, while the more alkaline foods produce an environment that facilitates the absorption
      of oxygen, so changing our eating habits while at the same time improving our respiratory processes in a conscious
      way can produce profoundly beneficial impacts on the body. A good measure to take into account is that the basis
      of our body's nutrition should be between seventy and eighty percent alkaline foods, something which can
      facilitate the state of homeostasis to prevent the development of gastro-intestinal diseases and health issues.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another determining factor to take into account when addressing the topic of breathing is undoubtedly a good
      hydration, as dehydration of the body can have a negative impact on oxygen levels in the blood. When you are
      dehydrated, red blood cells tend to clump together and stick together, causing a loss in the surface area and as a
      consequence a loss in the amount of oxygen they can carry.
      Another negative consequence of dehydration appears within the lungs themselves, specifically in
      the alveoli. There are drops of water inside each of the nearly 300 million alveoli that are contained in
      our lungs, drops of water that, thanks to the surface tension, facilitate the expulsion of carbon dioxide in the
      bloodstream into the air. When the body is dehydrated these water drops disappear and as a consequence there is a
      reduction in the capacity of the lungs to expel carbon dioxide, which has a negative impact in our daily life.

    <p>
      Having briefly clarified the breathing processes and the main negative consequences that appear by not properly
      oxygenating every cell in our body, I want now to focus your attention on the more optimistic aspects of a good
      breathing habit, focusing specifically on the most recent scientific evidences and also on the historical
      importance that certain philosophies and spiritual practices such as yoga have dedicated to breathing.

    What does a Danish man, the first person in the world to hold his breath underwater for more than
    twenty minutes; a Dutchman who managed to climb to seven thousand two hundred meters in the Everest mountain
    dressed only in shorts; and an elite athlete with 28 Olympic medals have in common? They all employed breathing
    techniques to achieve the impossible and go beyond the limits of the human mind and body.
  </p>
  <section id="sub-header-5">
    <h4 class="color">Breath retention and its benefits</h4>
    <p>
      The first of these great people is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stig_Severinsen">Stig Åvall
        Severinsen (PHD in Medicine, 4 times world champion in free diving, multiple Guinness records), who at his
        Forty-seven years of age has been experimenting with his own breathing for close to 40 years in order to improve
        his performance in water sports as diverse as underwater rugby or apnea. In his book <a
          href="https://www.breatheology.com/products/books/">Breatheology</a>, which I strongly recommend reading, he
        shows us a wide range of breathing techniques, with its origins in yoga, which have been adapted to the modern
        world in order for anyone to practice them with the hope of gaining not only greater control of their breath and
        increased lung capacity, but also incredible control over the immune system and the stress that often
        accompanies a life full of demands and responsibilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his own words:
    </p>
    <blockquote class="border-left">
      <p>
        <i>
          Many parallels can be drawn between freediving and yoga. The shared objective is to optimize and improve all
          the physiological and mental processes by gaining self-understanding, self-control and self-discipline.
          In time this will create a deeper understanding and respect for human nature and the way humans interact with
          each other as well as with their environment. Particularly our breathing, which we share with all other
          beings, is important because we can accomplish the most incredible things when we pay attention to our
          breathing.
        </i>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      That is the key that I intend to show with this essay: our breathing can be trained, in the same way as we train
      the body, so as to produce in us some physiological and mental changes that allow us to face new challenges in
      life and to live in a more courageous and happy way.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <a href="/images/posts/Nature/TheImportanceOfTheBreath/Severinsen.jpg"><img

    </figure>
    <p>
      As Severinsen explains in his book, breath retention underwater has been studied by scientists over the past few
      years and has recently been shown how during this type of breath retention so-called alpha waves are produced in
      the brain (brain waves with a frequency of oscillation between 8 and 15 Hz are considered alpha waves. While in a
      normal state of being, brain waves
      usually appear around the 16-31 Hz and are called beta waves). When the mind enters a frequency of waves
      known as alpha waves, it is considered that the person enters a state of calm and relaxation, similar to a form of
      trance or meditation. This effect is known in sports psychology as entering into a <i>flow state</i>. This ability
      to produce alpha waves demonstrates the effectiveness of applying sustained breath retention in a subaquatic
      environment and there is already a <a
        href="http://anti-aging.mfu.ac.th//File_PDF/research_inter/P2557_21.pdf">great
        diversity of studies</a> showing how by practicing deeper breathing patterns we can voluntarily access deeper
      brain wave states such as alpha, theta or even delta waves (the
      theta waves are produced when the frequency of the waves is around 4-7 Hz and usually occur in meditative states
      or during sleep, while frequencies below 4 Hz are considered delta waves, which appear in the deepest states of
      sleep or in very deep meditations).
    </p>
    <p>
      It is clear then, that the practice of sustained breath retention or simply the practice of deeper breaths allow
      the brain to reduce the frequency of brain waves and therefore allow an increase in the ability to concentrate as
      well as giving the person a greater tranquility where the most creative and perceptive mental faculties can bloom,
      thus allowing the <i>eureka</i> moments to happen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Previously we mentioned the problems that can arise when we stay in states of hypoxia and hypercapnia in a
      prolonged way. Now I want to offer a brief list with the benefits that the practice of
      breath retention has been shown to produce by taking advantage of these altered states for our benefit in a
      controlled fashion:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The body produces higher quantities of red blood cells which will help us to carry more oxygen around the body
        in the future, thus giving us an increased feeling of being energised.</li>
      <li>The body produces a vasodilation of the blood vessels, meaning the diameter of our blood vessels expands.</li>
      <li>Improved circulation of our bloodstream.</li>
      <li>Stem cells proliferate and their capacity to move around the body increases, in part because stem cells live
        in poor oxygen environments. This produces regenerative effects and can help repair old and damaged tissues - a
        celular rejuvenation occurs.</li>
      <li>In rat models it has been proved to promote neurogénesis by means of an increase in the proliferation of stem
        cells which can even help with our memory capacity, cognitive functions and can even act as an antidepressant.
      </li>
      <li>Adrenaline levels go up thus producing at the same time an increase in white blood cells, which improves our
        inmune system.</li>
      <li>Inflamation is lowered.</li>
      <li>Cortisol levels are reduced hour after the exercise and remain low for the rest of the day.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In a scientific study conducted by <a href="https://thorax.bmj.com/content/54/10/947"></a>Lundberg et al.</a> they
      show how nitric oxide (NO), a gas produced -or at least found- in the nasal cavity, can increase blood oxygenation
      by as much as 15% to 20% when inhaled through the nose to the lungs. This is because when this gas enters the
      lungs it helps to expand the alveoli, allowing faster oxygenation of the blood. James Nestor, in his book <a
        href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0818ZZNLR/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i0">Breath, The New Science of a
        Lost Art</a>, describes how when you breathe through your nose the concentration of this nitric oxide increases
      up to six times more than if we were breathing through our mouths. Nitric oxide has other virtues such as helping
      to treat erectile dysfunction, reduce blood pressure, increase sports performance or manage type 2 diabetes.

    <p>
      A good take on the importance that good breathing habits can have on our quality of life comes
      by the hand of a great medical study called the <a
        href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/science/framingham-heart-study-fhs">"Framingham Heart Study"</a>, in
      which they retrieved valuable and comprehensive information from more than 5000 subjects about their physical
      condition and lifestyle for over 50 years. This study showed, among many important findings, that the lung volume
      or lung capacity was the best parameter apart from age to predict when the subject will get sick or die. The
      conclusion of this study is very important because it shows us how the quality of our breathing can lengthen or
      shorten our life expectancy and therefore it is presented to us as an element of vital importance to maintain good
      health throughout our lives. If the bad habits we take along our life can bring us closer to illness and death
      such as smoking, alcohol or physical inactivity, we can also say that the opposite is true, that is, through good
      breathing and training habits we can improve and
      lengthen our quality of life and, in short, be able to live fully and consciously. Nowadays there is scientific
      evidence showing how lung capacity can be increased, with caution and care, using breathing and air-packing
      techniques (packing implies reaching the maximum load of air in the lungs producing a stretching of the lung
      tissues and is a modern technique used by
      many apnea divers).

    <h4 class="color">The breath and exposure to cold</h4>
    <p>
      Another of the great figures who have attracted the attention of science is a person called Wim Hof, colloquially
      known as the Iceman for his amazing ability to withstand extremely cold temperatures. Wim Hof is a Dutchman with
      an impressive amount of Guiness World records, although the
      medals are of no interest to us, for it is his prowess and extraordinary abilities that make him infinitely more
      striking and interesting. Wim has aroused the interest of
      sports journalists and people from many different places and varied interests who want to know his method so they
      can replicate his incredible miracles. A method he has coined under the name of Wim Hof Method (Wim Hof Method).
      Among his exploits are his records for swimming under the ice, records of time immersed in ice and as we mentioned
      before, his incredible climb to the Everest mountain in short pants.
    </p>
    <figure>

        his company Wim Hof Method.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      Wim Hof supports the idea that we are able to influence our own autonomic nervous system and immune system through
      breathing techniques, meditation and exposure to cold. As a matter of brevity and simplicity I will show you
      only one of the many studies he was subjected to in order to prove his claims, because although in every study and
      experiment he participates he has showed a series of remarkable
      capacities, this one study is enough to understand the potential and the effectiveness of breathing techniques and
      exposure to cold in order to improve our inmune response. With the results of this study we will be able to
      appreciate the physiological processes
      that occur in your body which many other people are already replicating in many parts of the planet. To
      investigate his life further you can always go to his book <a

      <figcaption class='caption-text'>In this diagram extracted from the previously mentioned study we can see how the
        group of people trained in the Wim Hof breathing technique where able to reduce their proinflamatory protein

    </figure>
    <p>
      In <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22685240/">this study (Matthijs Kox et al.)<a> an experiment was
          carried out to test his ability to influence his immune system. The experiment consisted on an injection of an
          endotoxin directly into the bloodstream. Normally this endotoxin produces in people an immediate immune
          reaction that is easily measured with scientific apparatus. This endotoxin has had contact with humans for
          hundreds of millions of years, so the immune system has developed an <b>automatic</b> response towards this
          toxin. This endotoxin binds to receptors known as <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toll-like_receptor">TLR, Toll-like receptors, which are a family of
            proteins that form a great part of our immune system. By binding to TLRs they release a huge amount of
            pro-inflammatory proteins. Patients in the control group developed an immune response that included fever,
            dizziness and tremors. In Wim's case, after practicing his breathing techniques, he was injected with the
            same endotoxin and did not present any of the symptoms. The researchers found an intense response from the
            sympathetic nervous system. His adrenaline levels rose rapidly before the endotoxin was
            injected and, being adrenaline an important part of the immune system response as it suppresses the
            inflammatory processes, is a good indicator of the immune system's response capacity. The amount of
            proinflammatory proteins released into the blood was much lower than that of the control group and his
            cortisol (stress hormone) returned to normal values more quickly than the control group.
    </p>
    <p>
      This experiment was repeated with a group of 24 people; 12 of whom were trained in his method of
      breathing, while the other 12 did not perform any preparation (the control group). All those who did not use
      his technique developed the symptoms described above: headache, fever... while the group that trained with his
      method did not develop any symptoms. For the first time an experiment clearly showed that anybody could
      influence their autonomic nervous system at will. Participants trained in his method presented elevated adrenaline
      levels along with an increase in the amount of anti-inflammatory proteins <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_10">IL-10</a> (interleukin-10), while showing a decreasing
      amount of proinflammatory proteins IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-alpha. In fact, their adrenaline levels went up so high
      that it surpassed those of a person bungee jumping. In the control group, on the other hand, their adrenaline
      levels and anti-inflammatory proteins remained low.
    </p>
    <p>
      I don't intend to show you the breathing technique used by Wim Hof so maybe your curiosity can guide you to find
      out more about it and to discover its amazing benefits, but what I will do is show you a few words by Wim Hof that
      present a simple way to experiment with your breath in the shower:
    </p>
    <blockquote class="border-left">
      <p>
        <i>
          Take a warm shower, as you always do. Then, while the water is still warm, start doing the following breathing
          exercises: Breathe in and breathe out slowly. Breathe in deeply and breathe out nice and slow. Keep doing this
          for about a minute—taking a total of six to ten breaths. Then, turn the shower to cold. Of course, you will
          start breathing more quickly and the cold will give you a shock. The trick is to breathe calmly again. Control
          your breathing under the cold shower. The moment your breathing is under control, the cold will feel
          different. If you find it difficult to set the shower to cold in one go, do it in two or three steps.

    <h4 class="color">The link between the body and the mind</h4>
    <p>
      I would like to conclude this brief presentation of elite athletes and conscious breathing experts with
      another clear example of the effectiveness that deep breathing can have on our physical and mental performance, as
      is the case with Michael Phelps, the most awarded olympic medalist in history. Phelps, a great elite swimmer, has
      always understood the importance of having good breathing patterns so as to improve his performance in the sport
      because, in swimming, knowing how to control the breath and how to hold the air in the lungs is an essential
      component to keep improving daily. However, <a
        href="https://www.businessinsider.com/michael-phelps-breathing-technique-for-mental-health-relaxation-2019-4?op=1">as
        he already revealed in 2019</a>, even though he knew about the importance of breathing in his sport, he did not
      yet know about its enormous potential as a therapy for relaxation and control of the mind. Phelps recognized that
      he was suffering from a depression that robbed him of his strength, sometimes preventing him from even leaving his
      own room.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a result of this problem he was facing he discovered that through long, deep breathing and by holding the air
      in each inhalation, a well studied technique in yoga, you can activate the parasimpathetic nervous system in order
      to send signals of relaxation and tranquility to the body, favoring in consequence a cascade of processes that
      allow the body to reduce the levels of stress and to improve the digestive and regenerative processes. Once Phelps
      discovered the incredible power that breathing can have to help reduce the effects of depression and to improve
      the quality of his mental health, he began teaching his young son a breathing technique named <a
        href="https://www.yogapedia.com/2/8385/breath/breathing-techniques/lions-breath">"the lion's breath"</a>, so
      that he too could benefit from this method of mental relaxation from an early age and so he would'nt have to go
      through what he went through.

    <cite>Marcus Aurelius</cite>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    Knowing closely how our body and our breathing work allows us to face our life in a more energetic and fruitful way,
    thus allowing us to endure the most challenging and stressful moments. The mere act of accepting that life involves
    suffering and pain frees us from the burden of thinking that our
    sufferings are something special and that they only affect us individually. This is why it is always good to
    remember that even though life may sometimes seem like a pile of injustices and constant suffering, we can always
    choose to adopt healthier habits such as better breathing patterns in order to cope with all these
    suffering and problems in a courageous and heroic way. For it is these two qualities, <b>courage</b> and
    <b>heroism</b>, in my opinion, the most important qualities to determine if along
    our life we are going to succumb to negative thoughts and tendencies or if we are going to take steps towards a more
    attractive life filled with hope and awe.

    Basically, what I am trying to express is that through a new way of understanding our body, where the breath becomes
    the link which unites our physical body with our mind and spirit, we can progress as individuals towards a more
    prosperous future, where we can take full advantage of our capabilities and this new
    energy that arises from correct breathing to progress and bring greater happiness to a world loaded with problems
    and injustices. I hope with this essay to have helped whoever has come across these lines and that, at least, it has
    served you to expand your horizon of possibilities to which you have access so as to improve your life
    daily. Carl G. Jung, in his book <a

      and the Collective Unconscious</a>, provides a phrase that, although in different contexts and meanings, can
    provide a good conclusion to the idea I've been trying to convey in this essay in reference to our ability to
    intentionally pay attention to our pains and negative thoughts so that we can dissolve them as we consciously
    breathe, as a kind of meditative exercise:
